This is the first file I uploaded on GitHub. It uses dynamic digital tubes to display a stopwatch and temperature. 
If the temperature exceeds 30°C, the digital tubes will show the temperature; 
if it's below 30°C, the stopwatch continues counting. The timing does not stop while displaying the temperature.
